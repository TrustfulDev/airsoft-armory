### Airsoft Armory
- Only 2-3 people have their entire loadouts on the site, I'll update the website as people send their pictures!

## Learning Objectives
- Understand next.js
- Dynamic Routing
- Static site generation
- File/Folder structure

## Notes
- It seems like the first website visit will have slow loading images, but it will be fast afterwards
- Overall mobile responsiveness could use some work
- Had issues with using height: 100vh, had to substitute it with padding-top
- Vietnamese tone marks and symbols would not display properly
- Pictures load slow on Vercel (Not sure if its a problem with the code or vercel)
- Having issues with using .PNG on Vercel (swapped to jpg)
- Overall I still need to understand all the concepts in learning objectives

## Packages Used
- react-icons
- react-fade-in
- framer-motion
